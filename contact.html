      <ul>FAQ:
      <br />
      <li>Can someone outside of the residence halls participate?
      <br />This isn't possible at this point in time due to the fact that this event is sponsored by res-hall funds.</li>
      <br />
      <li>Can I change the members of my team? 
      <br />Only under the most extenuating circumstances will this be allowed, the people you sign up with are the people you're hunting with, so make sure you get team members that are committed ;)</li>
      <br />
      <li>Is there a registration/participation fee?
      <br />No!!!   Registration and participation are free. As of now travel is not subsidized, but we are looking into that possibility. </li>
